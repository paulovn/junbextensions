# Jupyter Notebook extensions

This repository contains some extensions for Jupyter Notebook. They have been 
tested on Jupyter 4.0

 * An automatic Table of Contents. Modified from the [ToC extension](https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions)
 * A Search/Replace box. Based on the [Search&Replace extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/wiki/Search-&-Replace). Note that Jupyter 4.1 already comes with a search & replace dialog in the *Edit* menu.
 * A menubar button to toggle at the same time the header and the toolbar
